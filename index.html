  <p>Ah, another year, how grand, how fine,  
A day for cake, for gifts, for wine.  
But let's be real, it's just another day,  
One more step closer to hair turning grey.

Birthdays, they say, a reason to cheer,  
But aren't we just aging, year by year?  
Relatives calling, "Beta, you're grown!"  
As if wisdom and wrinkles are things to be shown.

Oh, the cake, so sweet, so nice,  
But another slice, and you'll pay the price.  
"Where's your job?" they'll slyly inquire,  
As if every birthday brings a corporate empire.

Gifts wrapped up, in fancy paper,  
Inside, another pair of socks, no caper.  
"Happy Birthday!" they all exclaim,  
As if this one’s not exactly the same.

So here's to you, with all my jest,  
May this birthday be better than the rest.  
Just kidding, it’s really the same old game,  
But hey, at least you’re not to blame!</p>
